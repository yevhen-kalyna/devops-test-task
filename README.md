# Tasks: Part 1

1. Build Dockerfile and run the image
2. Fix nginx error on container start
3. Fix '502 Bad Gateway' on localhost by changing Dockerfile.
4. Flask app behind nginx proxy should be available by localhost:80 when you run container
5. Check localhost:80 for next tasks

## General expectation

When I built image and then run container, I should see `Task: Part 2` html page in my localhost:80.
